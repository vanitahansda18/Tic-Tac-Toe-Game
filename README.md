# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

Tic Tac Toe Game ðŸŽ®
This project is a simple yet fun implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game written in Java. It allows two players to take turns playing the game on the same computer using a console-based interface. The program is designed in a clean and beginner-friendly way, making it a great starting point for anyone who wants to learn about basic game development, logic building, and Java programming fundamentals.

The game uses a traditional 3x3 grid board where one player plays as X and the other as O. Each player enters their move by specifying the row and column position on the board. The game then updates the board and checks for a winner after each move. If a player successfully places three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, they win the game. If the board is filled and no winner is found, the game declares the result as a draw.

This project has been created with simplicity in mind, without using any external libraries or frameworks, so that the focus remains on understanding the game logic. All game features are handled using basic Java concepts such as arrays, loops, conditions, and methods.

Running the game is very straightforward. First, you clone or download the project repository from GitHub. Once the files are on your system, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and compile the Java file using the javac command. After compilation, the game can be started by running the java command followed by the class name. Once started, the console will guide you by asking each player to enter their moves until the game reaches a conclusion.
